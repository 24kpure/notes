### Set

prohibition（禁止）

#### 1.综述

```
/**
 * A collection that contains no duplicate elements.  More formally, sets
 * contain no pair of elements <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code> such that
 * <code>e1.equals(e2)</code>, and at most one null element.  As implied by
 * its name, this interface models the mathematical <i>set</i> abstraction.
 * 
 * <p>The <tt>Set</tt> interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
 * inherited from the <tt>Collection</tt> interface, on the contracts of all
 * constructors and on the contracts of the <tt>add</tt>, <tt>equals</tt> and
 * <tt>hashCode</tt> methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
 * also included here for convenience.  (The specifications accompanying these
 * declarations have been tailored to the <tt>Set</tt> interface, but they do
 * not contain any additional stipulations.)
 *
    一个集合不包含相同元素。正式点说，set没有包含任意一对元素相等，并且之多一个null元素。如名所示，这个接口模型来自数学上的抽象。
    这个set的接口设置了一个额外的规定，超过那些继承自集合的接口，在所有构造器和add等方法上。为了便利在内声明了其它用于继承的方法。
 
 * <p>The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
 * that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
 * (as defined above).
 *
 * <p>Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
 * elements.  The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
 * is changed in a manner that affects <tt>equals</tt> comparisons while the
 * object is an element in the set.  A special case of this prohibition（禁止） is
 * that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.
 *
 
 * <p>Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * <tt>NullPointerException</tt> or <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the set may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 * 
   一些接口实现会有限定含有元素。比如 一些实现禁止空值，一些有约束其元素的类型。其它和Collection类似。
 
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

 * @param <E> the type of elements maintained by this set

####  2.方法（过滤和Collection一致的部分）

1.然后发现 啥都没有了
